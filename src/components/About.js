                <p> <strong>Hi! I’m Shamira! </strong>This is my about section so guess what I’m “about” to do. Yes! Tell you a little about myself. Well, let’s see.  I am Full Stack Developer and Graphic Design Student. I got into the field of Web Development and Graphic Design due to wanting to create finished products that made others smile (and sometimes drool over my work, jk).  </p>

                <p>My hobbies include playing the guitar, photography, and also gaming. Yes, I like to play video games. In particular I like to play Fortnite. Not only that, I love comic book movies. I grew up with a lot of male cousins so that’s just part of who I am. </p>

                <p>I don’t always take my self seriously but I know that there is a time and a place for everything. When it comes to my work I’m serious about getting it done. My definition of completing an assignment is not just saying ‘Hey I completed all these steps so let’s check this off as done. Completing an assignment means going above and beyond. My work is a reflection of who I am and let me tell you and since I’m AWESOME my work should totally reflect that! </p>

                <p>So with that being said, let’s make some awesome projects together. Talk to you soon!!</p>
